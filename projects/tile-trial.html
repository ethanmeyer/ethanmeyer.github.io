        <p style="float: left" id="margin">This project is a collaboration
          between 2 other students and myself that was completed on June 1, 2022.
          Tile Trial is a multiplayer puzzle
          game connected over the internet. Each "tile" has 4 sides which need
          to be matched to other tiles. One photo I have included shows an early
          prototype as well as how the game could have been scored. We made this
          game within the GameMaker Studio 2 application and used be using
          GameMaker Language to program the logic of the game. I worked on the
          tcp networking and multiplayer gameplay for Tile Trial.

          To do the networking I had to sync game clients to one game server which
          was hosted by one of the players. When an action was performed it was sent from
          a client to the server. From there the server sent a message to all clients that
          an action had happened. In testing we had to balance the rate that we
          would send messages and making sure players could still have a smooth
          visual experience.
