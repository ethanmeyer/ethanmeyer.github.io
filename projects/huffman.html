      <h1>Huffman Tree Encoding</h1>
      <h3>Technologies Used: C++</h3>
      <h3>May 2019<h3>
      <div id="main-content">
        <p style="float: left" id="margin">This was an in-class project for my
          Data Structures 2 course. We were tasked with using lexical analysis
          to first analyze a text file and then, after determining how many of
          each character appeared, we built a Huffman tree. Once our tree had
          been built, we re-encode the original file by switching every character
          with its new Huffman equivalent. This project features classes, file
          input, and file manipulation. To the right, you can see a sample output
          of the program after it has analyzed the characters and has created a
          Huffman tree of the characters. You can find more information about
          huffman coding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
